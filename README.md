# Homework 5 - Day Planner

## Description

This program is created to aid the user in listing down daily activities to effectively manage their days. This simple daily calender allows a user to save events for each hour of the day from 9am to 5pm to local storage and can be accessed whenever needed. This program heavily relies on javascript, J Query, Moment.js and bootstrap to dynamically update the page with elements such as the current time, changing of the colors to denote past, present or future and uses bootstrap for the UI/UX.
